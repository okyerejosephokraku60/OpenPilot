How to Activate OpenPilot in Termux


What is OpenPilot?

OpenPilot is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported car makes, models, and model years. In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about the vehicle integration and limitations.


I don't have access to the OP's specific commands. However, I can give you some general commands that you can use in Termux. But first, make sure you have installed Git, Python, and Pip on your Termux application. Here are the general steps:

1. Open the Termux application on your device.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
```
pkg install -y git python make clang libcrypt-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev zlib-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev libffi-dev openssl-dev
```

3. Install the Virtual Environment and activate it, running the following commands:
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Clone the OpenPilot repository using Git, running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/commaai/openpilot
```

5. Install the OpenPilot's dependencies, running the following commands:
```
cd openpilot
python tools/download_deps.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Start the OpenPilot application, running the following command:
```
python selfdrive/ui/replay.py
```
Please be aware that these are just general commands and may not work in all systems. Also, activating OpenPilot may require additional steps that are not presented here.
